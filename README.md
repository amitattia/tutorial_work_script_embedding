# tutorial_work_script_embedding

event_order_files are files from the repository: https://github.com/zoharai/Lexical-Event-Ordering-with-an-Edge-Factored-Model---improved used in this work.

embedding.py is the script which runs the experiments settings, with two functions, one for each settings. The current parameters are for the settings in the paper of Modi and Titov.
embedding_model.py is an incorrect implementation of the model, which is in the repository for completness.
